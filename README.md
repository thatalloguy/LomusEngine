# LomusEngine

LomusEngine is a game engine written in C++ with Opengl 3.0 core.

# NOTE
This engine is still in its very rough early stages.
I am planning to make this engine into a fully edged engine with ton of bells and whistles.


# How development is going:
This is a passion project made by only 1 person so progress is slow ðŸ˜­
When developing the key thing that I keep in mind: workflow.
When programming new features I always think how it will interact with the rest of the codebase.
