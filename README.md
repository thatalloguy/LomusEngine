# LomusEngine Refactored


## Why refactor?

I like lomus and while developing lomus I learned alot of new techniques and theories.
After Lomus I worked on another (unamed) engine and I've learned so so so much there.
Lomus has lots of system that are a mess and outdated.


## Whats planned?

- ECS:
  #### bye bye the old clunky gameObject and SceneManager, especially that dirty gameObject class god do I hate that! instead i want a simple (custom made) ecs.

- New physics implementation:
  #### Im not entirely sure on this one, but il either switch to a new physics engine or rewrite my implementation.

- My truth:
  #### Lomus never had any kind of reflection or asset manager, and i want one! (ofc inspired of the truth from our macheniry )

- Better Editor:
  #### The current editor code is a MESS so i wanna rewrite it to make it more dynamic. I also wanna add docking since i miss that :cry:

- Render Layer:
  #### The current lomus uses plain raw opengl which i dont like, instead i want a layer inbetween so that later on i have the ability to add support for other graphics api's


## This sounds alot like skore lite!
  
## TODO

- [ ] Clean up main.cpp
- [ ] Clean up Lomus source
- [ ] Start ECS
